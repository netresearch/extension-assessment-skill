# Extension Assessment Skill

Systematic compliance assessment for TYPO3 extensions against all Netresearch skills.

## Why This Skill Exists

When asked to "ensure extension aligns with all skills", LLMs typically:
- Cherry-pick obvious issues (satisficing)
- Miss 50-80% of requirements
- Report "done" without exhaustive verification

This skill enforces **systematic verification** through:
1. **Scripted pre-flight checks** (mechanical, 100% accurate)
2. **Domain-batched LLM agents** (subjective judgment)
3. **Structured JSON output** (verifiable completeness)

## Running the Assessment

### Slash Command

```
/assess-extension
```

### What Happens

1. **Detect extension root** (look for ext_emconf.php or composer.json with typo3-cms-extension)
2. **Discover all skills** from plugin cache and local skills
3. **Find checkpoints** for each skill using convention-with-override pattern
4. **Run scripted checks** (file_exists, contains, regex, etc.)
5. **Group LLM checkpoints** by domain
6. **Spawn domain agents** (3-4 parallel agents)
7. **Collect JSON results** from each agent
8. **Validate completeness** (all checkpoints have status)
9. **Generate compliance report**

## Checkpoint Discovery (Convention-with-Override)

For each skill, checkpoints are discovered using this logic:

```
1. Parse SKILL.md front matter
2. If `checkpoints:` key exists → use that explicit path (override)
3. Else if checkpoints.yaml exists in skill root → use it (convention)
4. Else → no checkpoints, skip this skill
```

### Skill Structure with Checkpoints

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Skill content, optional checkpoints: key
├── checkpoints.yaml      # Auto-discovered by convention
└── references/
    └── llm-rubric.md     # LLM review prompts (optional)
```

### Why Convention-with-Override?

| Pattern | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Convention** | Zero config, predictable location | Less flexible |
| **Override** | Full control, non-standard paths | Requires config |
| **Both** | Best of both worlds | Slightly more complex discovery |

Skills can either:
- Drop `checkpoints.yaml` in root (convention) - **recommended**
- Or specify `checkpoints: path/to/custom.yaml` in front matter (override)

## Checkpoint Types

For full schema, see `references/checkpoints-schema.md`.

### Mechanical Checks (Scripted)

| Type | Runner | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `file_exists` | Script | `test -f $target` |
| `file_not_exists` | Script | `test ! -f $target` |
| `contains` | Script | `grep -q "$pattern" $target` |
| `not_contains` | Script | `! grep -q "$pattern" $target` |
| `regex` | Script | `grep -qE "$pattern" $target` |
| `json_path` | Script | `jq -e "$path" $target` |
| `gh_api` | Script | GitHub API check via `gh api` |
| `command` | Script | Run arbitrary command, check exit code |

### LLM Reviews (Agent)

| Type | Runner | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `llm_review` | Agent | Requires LLM judgment, grouped by domain |

## Domain Groups for LLM Agents

Related checkpoints are batched by domain for efficient processing:

| Domain | Skills | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `repo-health` | github-project, netresearch-branding, agents | README, badges, branding, AGENTS.md |
| `security` | enterprise-readiness, security-audit | SLSA, OpenSSF, SBOM, vulnerabilities |
| `code-quality` | typo3-conformance, php-modernization, typo3-testing | PHPStan, tests, PHP 8.x patterns |
| `documentation` | typo3-docs | RST, rendering, docs.typo3.org standards |

## Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Checkpoints

```bash
# Find all skills with checkpoints
for skill_dir in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/skills/*/; do
  skill_md="$skill_dir/SKILL.md"
  checkpoints_yaml="$skill_dir/checkpoints.yaml"

  # Check override in front matter
  override=$(grep -E "^checkpoints:" "$skill_md" 2>/dev/null | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')

  if [[ -n "$override" ]]; then
    checkpoint_file="$skill_dir/$override"
  elif [[ -f "$checkpoints_yaml" ]]; then
    checkpoint_file="$checkpoints_yaml"
  else
    continue  # No checkpoints for this skill
  fi

  echo "Found: $checkpoint_file"
done
```

### Step 2: Run Scripted Checks (Tier 1)

For each mechanical checkpoint:

```bash
scripts/run-checkpoints.sh <checkpoint-file.yaml> <project-root>
```

This runs all `file_exists`, `contains`, `regex`, etc. checks without any LLM involvement.

### Step 3: Run Domain Agents (Tier 2)

Group `llm_review` checkpoints by domain, spawn one agent per domain:

```
Agent: repo-health
Checkpoints: GH-15, GH-16, NB-01, AG-01
Prompt: "You are auditing repo health. Verify these checkpoints..."
Output: JSON with pass/fail per checkpoint
```

### Step 4: Aggregate Results

Collect all results into compliance report:

```json
{
  "extension": "netresearch/contexts",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-30T19:00:00Z",
  "overall_status": "FAIL",
  "summary": {
    "total": 45,
    "pass": 38,
    "fail": 5,
    "skip": 2
  },
  "checkpoints": [
    {"id": "GH-01", "skill": "github-project", "status": "pass", "evidence": "README.md exists"},
    {"id": "GH-03", "skill": "github-project", "status": "fail", "evidence": "Missing codecov badge"}
  ]
}
```

## Checkpoints YAML Format

Create `checkpoints.yaml` in your skill root:

```yaml
version: 1
skill_id: github-project

mechanical:
  - id: GH-01
    type: file_exists
    target: README.md
    severity: error
    desc: "README.md must exist"

  - id: GH-02
    type: contains
    target: README.md
    pattern: "codecov.io"
    severity: warning
    desc: "README should have Codecov badge"

llm_reviews:
  - id: GH-15
    domain: repo-health
    rubric: references/llm-rubric.md#badge-order
    severity: warning
    desc: "Verify badge ordering follows standard"

  - id: GH-16
    domain: repo-health
    prompt: |
      Check README structure for standard sections:
      - Installation/Setup
      - Configuration
      - Development
      - License
    severity: info
    desc: "README should have standard sections"
```

For full schema documentation, see `references/checkpoints-schema.md`.

## Agent Prompt Template

Each domain agent receives this prompt:

```markdown
You are an automated compliance auditor for TYPO3 extensions.

## Your Task
Verify the extension against ONLY the checkpoints listed below.
You must NOT fix issues - only report compliance status.

## Output Format
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "domain": "repo-health",
  "checkpoints": [
    {
      "id": "GH-15",
      "status": "pass" | "fail" | "skip",
      "evidence": "Quote the specific line/file or explain why it fails/passes"
    }
  ]
}

## Checkpoints to Verify
[CHECKPOINTS INJECTED HERE]

## Rules
- Every checkpoint MUST have a status (no nulls)
- Evidence MUST be specific (line numbers, quotes)
- "skip" only if checkpoint doesn't apply to this extension type
- Be strict - when in doubt, mark as "fail"
```

## Validation Rules

The assessment is NOT complete until:

- [ ] All skills were scanned for checkpoints
- [ ] All scripted checks returned exit code
- [ ] All domain agents returned valid JSON
- [ ] All checkpoints have non-null status
- [ ] Evidence field is non-empty for all fail/pass

If ANY validation fails → retry that component

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `error` | Must fix before release | Blocks release |
| `warning` | Should fix | Recommendation |
| `info` | Nice to have | Optional |

## Implementation Notes

### Why Domain Batching?

- **Not 20 agents** (one per skill) - too expensive, rate limits
- **Not 1 agent** (all skills) - context overload, satisficing
- **3-4 domain agents** - balanced context, related checks grouped

### Why Scripted Checks First?

- **Zero LLM cost** for mechanical checks
- **100% accuracy** (no hallucination)
- **Faster** than LLM
- **Catches 60-70%** of issues without any LLM calls

### Checkpoint ID Convention

```
{SKILL_PREFIX}-{NUMBER}

GH-01  = github-project checkpoint 1
ER-01  = enterprise-readiness checkpoint 1
TC-01  = typo3-conformance checkpoint 1
```

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Add checkpoints to pilot skills (github-project, enterprise-readiness, agents)
2. **Phase 2**: Test assessment on contexts extension
3. **Phase 3**: Add checkpoints to remaining skills
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate with CI (automated assessment on PR)

## Troubleshooting

### "Checkpoint X has null status"
Agent failed to evaluate that checkpoint. Re-run with verbose mode.

### "Domain agent returned invalid JSON"
Prompt may need adjustment. Check agent output for parsing errors.

### "Scripted check failed unexpectedly"
Verify target path is correct. Check if file exists.

### "No checkpoints found for skill X"
Skill doesn't have checkpoints.yaml and no override in front matter. Add checkpoints.yaml following the schema.
